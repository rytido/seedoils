# Seed Oil Resources

This page includes excerpts from and links to various studies, publications, tweets, etc showing the unhealthy nature of seed oils.

## Summary

- Seed oils are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
- PUFAs are unstable and oxidize easily, particularly in the presence of sunlight
- Their breakdown produces unhealthy substances including 4-HNE
- The oil production process requires repeated high heat and chemicals to remove the rancid smell of the oil
- The quantity of seeds required to produce a relatively small amount of oil is much more than a human could resonably consume in seed form
- Linoleic acid, a PUFA, can affect your endocannabinoid system to give you the munchies

## Brain

### [[Soybean oil] causes genetic changes in the brain](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/americas-most-widely-consumed-cooking-oil-causes-genetic-changes-brain)

> UC Riverside research shows soybean oil not only leads to obesity and diabetes, but could also affect neurological conditions like autism, Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, and depression.

### [High fried food consumption impacts anxiety and depression](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221097120)

> To address a crucial knowledge deficiency concerning the correlation between fried food consumption and the risk of anxiety and depression, here we revealed that frequent fried food consumption is strongly associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression. Notably, acrylamide is a representative contaminant in fried foods, thereby further elucidating its toxicological mode of action. We demonstrated that long-term exposure to acrylamide induces anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors via oxidative stress-mediated neuroinflammation, and unravel the underlying mechanism that PPAR signaling pathway mediates acrylamide-induced lipid metabolism disorder in brain.

[But not all fats are equal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616308652)

> Significantly less acrylamide was produced in saturated animal fat than in unsaturated cooking oil, with 366 ng/g in lard and 211 ng/g in ghee versus 2447 ng/g in soy oil, followed by palm olein with 1442 ng/g.

## Gut

### [The munchies](https://www.zeroacre.com/blog/seed-oils-cause-the-munchies)

> THC isn’t the only compound capable of activating CB1 receptors. Your body naturally produces compounds called "endocannabinoids."
> These endocannabinoids, primarily 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), can also activate CB1 receptors and trigger hunger – even on a full stomach.
> Your body makes 2-AG and AEA endocannabinoids exclusively from arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). And while arachidonic acid is present in trace amounts in food, your body primarily produces it from its precursor: linoleic acid. In other words, when you consume linoleic acid, some of it is converted into arachidonic acid, which leads to the production of endocannabinoids 2-AG and AEA. These endocannabinoids stimulate our appetite and ultimately, may cause you to eat more.

## Heart

### [Sydney Diet Heart Study](https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707)

> In this cohort, substituting dietary linoleic acid in place of saturated fats increased the rates of death from all causes, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. An updated meta-analysis of linoleic acid intervention trials showed no evidence of cardiovascular benefit.

## Liver

[Soybean Oil Is More Obesogenic and Diabetogenic than Coconut Oil and Fructose in Mouse: Potential Role for the Liver](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132672)

> Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.

## Skin

[Mice fed 20% saturated fat were almost completely protected from UV tumorigenesis when compared with mice fed 20% polyunsaturated fat.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1988.tb02882.x)

## Consumption

### [The dose makes the poison](https://twitter.com/SeedOilDsrspctr/status/1673319439968739328)

- Five tbsp of sunflower oil requires 2800 sunflower seeds (my own estimate below is actually higher)
  - [~29K seeds per kg of seeds](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/species/62/sunflower)
  - [~2.3kg seeds per kg of oil](http://www.doingoilmachine.com/FAQ/how_many_sunflowers_make_a_kg_of_oil_938.html)
  - [1kg oil is 67 tbsp](https://www.inchcalculator.com/convert/kilogram-to-tablespoon/)
  - 29000 \* 2.3 / 67 \* 5 ~= 5000
- Five tbsp of corn oil requires 98 ears of corn

### [Consumption is increasing](https://twitter.com/SeedOilDsrspctr/status/1672235847146504192?s=20)

## Concerning uses

[Hogstop active ingredient is cottonseed oil](https://hiprofeeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/13417225.pdf)

> Contraceptive bait for feral hogs. Reduces the fertility of male feral hogs within 5 days.

## 4-HNE

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Hydroxynonenal)

> Since 1991, OαβUAs are receiving a great deal of attention because they are being considered as possible causal agents of numerous diseases, such as chronic inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, adult respiratory distress syndrome, atherogenesis, diabetes and different types of cancer.

> Mustard oil is a liquid oil that is low in saturated fat and is popular in South Asia.It contains a large proportion of erucic acid, a fatty acid associated with myocardial lipidosis in rodents. This evidence prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of mustard oil for cooking.
