## Brain

### [[Soybean oil] causes genetic changes in the brain](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/americas-most-widely-consumed-cooking-oil-causes-genetic-changes-brain)

> UC Riverside research shows soybean oil not only leads to obesity and diabetes, but could also affect neurological conditions like autism, Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, and depression.

### [High fried food consumption impacts anxiety and depression](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221097120)

> To address a crucial knowledge deficiency concerning the correlation between fried food consumption and the risk of anxiety and depression, here we revealed that frequent fried food consumption is strongly associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression. Notably, acrylamide is a representative contaminant in fried foods, thereby further elucidating its toxicological mode of action. We demonstrated that long-term exposure to acrylamide induces anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors via oxidative stress-mediated neuroinflammation, and unravel the underlying mechanism that PPAR signaling pathway mediates acrylamide-induced lipid metabolism disorder in brain.

[But not all fats are equal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616308652)

> Significantly less acrylamide was produced in saturated animal fat than in unsaturated cooking oil, with 366 ng/g in lard and 211 ng/g in ghee versus 2447 ng/g in soy oil, followed by palm olein with 1442 ng/g.

## Gut

### [The munchies](https://www.zeroacre.com/blog/seed-oils-cause-the-munchies)

> THC isn’t the only compound capable of activating CB1 receptors. Your body naturally produces compounds called "endocannabinoids."
> These endocannabinoids, primarily 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), can also activate CB1 receptors and trigger hunger – even on a full stomach.
> Your body makes 2-AG and AEA endocannabinoids exclusively from arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). And while arachidonic acid is present in trace amounts in food, your body primarily produces it from its precursor: linoleic acid. In other words, when you consume linoleic acid, some of it is converted into arachidonic acid, which leads to the production of endocannabinoids 2-AG and AEA. These endocannabinoids stimulate our appetite and ultimately, may cause you to eat more.

## Heart

### [Sydney Diet Heart Study](https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707)

> In this cohort, substituting dietary linoleic acid in place of saturated fats increased the rates of death from all causes, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. An updated meta-analysis of linoleic acid intervention trials showed no evidence of cardiovascular benefit.

## Liver

[Soybean Oil Is More Obesogenic and Diabetogenic than Coconut Oil and Fructose in Mouse: Potential Role for the Liver](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132672)

> Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.

## Consumption

### [The dose makes the poison](https://twitter.com/SeedOilDsrspctr/status/1673319439968739328)

- Five tbsp of sunflower oil requires 2800 sunflower seeds (my own estimate below is actually higher)
  - [~29K seeds per kg of seeds](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/species/62/sunflower)
  - [~2.3kg seeds per kg of oil](http://www.doingoilmachine.com/FAQ/how_many_sunflowers_make_a_kg_of_oil_938.html)
  - [1kg oil is 67 tbsp](https://www.inchcalculator.com/convert/kilogram-to-tablespoon/)
  - 29000 \* 2.3 / 67 \* 5 ~= 5000
- Five tbsp of corn oil requires 98 ears of corn

### [Why did saturated fat get a bad rap?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9794145/)

> The idea that saturated fats cause heart disease, called the diet-heart hypothesis, was introduced in the 1950s, based on weak, associational evidence. Subsequent clinical trials attempting to substantiate this hypothesis could never establish a causal link. However, these clinical-trial data were largely ignored for decades, until journalists brought them to light about a decade ago. Subsequent reexaminations of this evidence by nutrition experts have now been published in >20 review papers, which have largely concluded that saturated fats have no effect on cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality or total mortality.

## Other

### [Euric Acid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924350/#:~:text=Mustard%20oil%20is%20a%20liquid,of%20mustard%20oil%20for%20cooking)

> Mustard oil is a liquid oil that is low in saturated fat and is popular in South Asia.It contains a large proportion of erucic acid, a fatty acid associated with myocardial lipidosis in rodents. This evidence prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of mustard oil for cooking.
